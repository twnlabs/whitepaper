### Governance & Voting

#### Initial (Bootstrap) Governance Vote (Scheduled)
- Date: April 15, 2026 (scheduled)
- Venue: TWN Platform (off‑chain vote)
- Purpose: To decide whether to enable controlled early‑unlock behavior for NFT locks (time‑locks) under clearly defined guardrails.
- Guardrails & Execution:
  - Quorum and approval thresholds will be published prior to voting
  - Result will be encoded on‑chain via Squads multisig with a timelocked execution
  - All artifacts (proposal text, tally, executed txids) will be published for auditability

Note: This one‑time bootstrap vote will be conducted off‑chain to ensure accessibility and speed. Subsequent governance will transition to the on‑chain model per the roadmap.

## Token Economics

### Launch Model: Fair Launch on Pump.fun

TWN launches on Pump.fun using a bonding-curve sale. There are no private/VC allocations and no whitelists—everyone buys under the same curve. When the token meets Pump.fun's graduation criteria, an LP on Raydium is created and the LP tokens are burned (sent to an inaccessible address) / effectively locked, reducing rug-pull risk and enabling immediate DEX trading. Exact threshold/fees are set by Pump.fun and may change over time; we'll publish the live parameters and on-chain tx references at launch.

### Supply, Symbol, Mint

#### Token Specifications
```json
{
  "name": "TWN Token",
  "symbol": "TWN", 
  "decimals": 9,
  "totalSupply": 1,000,000,000,
  "address": "TBA (to be announced post‑launch via official channels)"
}
```

### Team Acquisition (Market-Based)

**Target**: The core team will buy up to ~10% of supply on the launching process.

**Lockup**: 100% locked for 6 months.

**Post-lock split (after Month 6)**:
- **50% → Treasury**: `2Y1nPntVbpgeCoXzKuA5uSuhwWozPyGGs99NiaTnRqQL`
- **35% → Community**: `4KU3aQS1BcLpDQrxuA6UsugN141e1QiHxByaCe1STChV`
- **15% → Developer**: `AXvwpxhAb2hU7YGsfdkLxFaDunX5jUGtZKWiDQRnvhuQ`

*All three wallets will be secured with multisig + timelock; parameters and txids will be published.*

### Monthly Platform Revenues → TWN

**Source**: Platform NFT mint revenues in SOL.

**Conversion**: Once per month at a random day/time, accumulated SOL is converted to TWN using Jupiter with a TWAP/DCA execution. Where available, we'll use MEV-aware/private routing to reduce sandwich risk.

**Distribution (once a month, in TWN)**: 50% Treasury / 35% Community / 15% Developer (wallets above).

**Transparency**: Monthly reports will include swap routes, execution parameters (slippage/caps), and all tx signatures.

### Wallet Purposes

#### Treasury Wallet
- Infrastructure (nodes/hosting)
- Audits & security
- Marketing & partnerships
- Listings/integrations
- Legal/compliance
- Emergency reserves
- Strategic liquidity support

#### Community Wallet
- Staking bonuses
- In-app rewards
- Games & giveaways
- Community grants/incentives

#### Developer Wallet
- Core team compensation
- Contributor bounties
- R&D
- Maintenance

### Liquidity & Security

**Liquidity Note**: Upon Pump.fun graduation, Raydium LP is created and LP tokens are burned/locked by design; graduation and LP details will be included in the launch report.

**Security Features**:
- Multisig wallet protection
- Timelock mechanisms
- Transparent on-chain operations
- Monthly revenue reports
- No private allocations
- Fair launch model

### Why Pump.fun for TWN? (Trust, Fit, and Execution)

#### **Fair, Transparent Start**
A bonding-curve sale treats all participants equally—no private/VC rounds, no whitelists. The rules are on-chain and visible from day one.

#### **Instant Liquidity with Strong Anti-Rug Optics**
Upon graduation, Pump.fun auto-creates a Raydium pool and burns/locks the LP, which materially reduces the risk of liquidity being pulled and gives users immediate DEX trading.

#### **Frictionless Access Across Solana**
Once live, Jupiter routing makes TWN easy to trade via common wallets and aggregators; discovery and liquidity are there from the start.

#### **Speed and Simplicity**
We avoid months of custom token/LP infrastructure work. That lets us focus engineering time on the AI twin product (voice, avatars, agent tooling) instead of token plumbing.

#### **Aligned with Community-First Narrative**
We want the earliest holders to be actual users and builders who interact with the product—not a closed investor group. Pump.fun's open curve and social discovery fit that goal.

#### **On-Chain Provenance**
Every step—mint, bonding-curve fills, graduation, LP creation—is auditable, which strengthens trust when combined with our public reports and multisig/timelock policies.

**TL;DR**: Pump.fun lets us start fair, liquid, and auditable without diluting focus from the core product. That's why it's the best fit for TWN's user-centric launch.

```

#### Phase 2 Database Migration (PostgreSQL)
- We will migrate the primary database from MySQL to PostgreSQL in Phase 2 to unlock advanced indexing, native JSON, and richer analytics.
- Migration readiness today:
  - Normalized schemas and strict UTF-8 (utf8mb4) collation ensure portability
  - All writes use prepared statements and transactions (PDO), easing parity
  - Read/write paths are service-isolated, enabling a staged cutover
  - A dual-run plan (shadow reads on PostgreSQL) will validate parity before switch
  - ETL plan: logical export + transform (e.g., pgloader-compatible), zero‑downtime cutover window
  - Connection pooling and read replicas will be configured post‑migration

## API & Integration Layer

### RESTful API Architecture

We will follow a phased API disclosure strategy to balance security, competitive advantage, and developer enablement. Rather than publishing specific endpoints at launch, we outline capabilities and timing below.

#### Phased API Disclosure Strategy

- Phase 1: Launch (Current)
  - Specific endpoints remain private
  - High-level feature descriptions only
  - Full transparency on technical stack and architecture
  - Security-first posture (rate-limiting, JWT, validation, monitoring)

- Phase 2: Growth (3–6 months)
  - Public API documentation for selected, stable surfaces
  - Developer SDKs and integration guides
  - Community integrations and third‑party developer program

- Phase 3: Ecosystem (6+ months)
  - Full API documentation with versioning and changelogs
  - Developer portal and API marketplace
  - Open-source components for community contributions

#### What You’ll Be Able To Build

- Text-to-Speech experiences powered by cloned voices
- Secure voice cloning flows for user-owned AI twins
- Twin asset management (listing, loading, sharing) via secure services
- Wallet-connected flows for minting and identity linking (post‑launch)
- Real-time interactions, notifications, and status updates

This approach ensures a fair, secure launch while enabling a robust developer ecosystem as the platform matures.

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management (current)
- **OAuth 2.0**: Third-party integration (planned – Phase 2)
- **Role-based Access**: Granular permissions (current)
- **Rate Limiting**: Abuse prevention (current)

### Real-time Communication

#### WebSocket Integration (Planned Disclosure)
Real-time events (progress, notifications) are supported. Specific server and client implementations will be disclosed in Phase 2 alongside SDKs.

#### Event-driven Architecture
- **NFT Minting**: Real-time status updates
- **AI Processing**: Progress notifications
- **Marketplace**: Price and availability updates
- **Social Features**: Interaction notifications
